<p>You need to add a selector to your service. This will tell Kubernetes how to find your deployment. Additionally you can use nodePort to specify the port number of your service. After doing that you will be able to curl your MicroK8s IP.</p>
<p>Your Service YAML should look like this:</p>
<pre><code>apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: my-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    nodePort: 30001
  selector: 
    name: my-service      
status:
  loadBalancer: {}
</code></pre>
