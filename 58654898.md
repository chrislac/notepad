<p>You need to sort it out what is using these ports:</p>
<pre><code>[WARNING Port-10250]: Port 10250 is in use
error execution phase preflight: [preflight] Some fatal errors occurred:
[ERROR Port-10251]: Port 10251 is in use
[ERROR Port-10252]: Port 10252 is in use
[ERROR Port-2380]: Port 2380 is in use
</code></pre>
<p>This is preventing you system to load. This is described on the <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/reference/drivers/none/">documentation</a>. To investigate you can use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo lsof -i :10251
</code></pre>
<p>If you donâ€™t have this command installed you can install it using:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install lsof
</code></pre>
<p>Running minikube with <code>--vm-driver=none</code> is possible but the recommended. By using none Driver, you have decreased reliability, decreased security, risk of data loss and more. Refer to <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/reference/drivers/none/">documentation</a> for more details.</p>
<p>There is an issue opened to address these security problems. <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/3760">#3760</a></p>
<p>The best way of doing it on Linux is using kvm. To accomplish that you can follow these instructions (assuming you have Docker CE installed):</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install -y qemu-kvm libvirt-clients libvirt-daemon-system
$ sudo adduser $USER libvirt
</code></pre>
<p>And run minikube with kvm2 driver:</p>
<pre><code>$ minikube start --vm-driver kvm2 --kubernetes-version v1.15.0
</code></pre>
