<p>Kubenet is a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dual-stack/#prerequisites">requirement</a> for enabling IPv6 and as you stated, kubenet have some limitations and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/#kubenet">here</a> we can read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Kubenet is a very basic, simple network plugin</strong>, on Linux only. <strong>It does<br>
not, of itself, implement more advanced features</strong> like cross-node<br>
networking or network policy. It is typically used together with a<br>
<strong>cloud provider that sets up routing rules</strong> for communication between<br>
nodes, or in single-node environments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would like to highlight that kubenet is not creating routes automatically for you.</p>
<p>Based on this information we can understand that in your scenario this is the expected behavior and there is no problem happening.<br>
If you want to keep going in this direction you need to create routes manually.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember this is an alpha feature (WIP).</p>
<p>There is also some work being done to make it possible to bootstrap a <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubeadm/issues/1612">Kubernetes cluster with Dual Stack using Kubeadm</a>.</p>
<p>Optionally I would like to suggest you to take a look at <a href="https://github.com/Nordix/k8s-ipv6/tree/dual-stack">this</a> project.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This project serves two primary purposes: (i) study and validate ipv6<br>
support in kubernetes and associated plugins (ii) provide a dev<br>
environment for implementing and testing additional functionality<br>
<strong>(e.g.dual-stack)</strong></p>
