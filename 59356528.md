<p>In general, "Kubernetes ingress Controller Fake certificate¨ indicates problems on the certificates itself or in your setup. You can read more about it <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/1044">here</a>, <a href="https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/options/troubleshooting/#cert-cn-is-kubernetes-ingress-controller-fake-certificate">here</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/4674">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/1984">here</a>.</p>
<p>None of these posts will tell you how to solve your problem as the reason may be very wide and depends on your certificate and how it was generated.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/4674#issuecomment-558504185">Here</a> for example, it’s reported that problem was not in the certificate itself but in his ingress:</p>

sure if this is required, but it fixed the issues and now the cert.<br>
being used is the one I’m providing and not the Fake Kubernetes one).<br>
Example of my ingress:</p>

<p>So, I as suggested in the comments, you reviewed the steps used to generate your certificate and discovered that adding the certificate common name to the list of SANs and regenerating the self-signed certificate fixed the problem.</p>
