<p>To send mails from your container you need to have any mail service running. You managed to install sendmail and this is the right way to do it. You probably based your Docker Image on a Centos machine. You can choose different images as Debian, Ubuntu and so on. These images have the minimal packages installed, so thatâ€™s why you need to install sendmail in order to enable this functionality.</p>
<p>You can also search on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/search?q=sendmail&amp;type=image">Docker Hub</a> for a image that already contains sendmail or any other mail service that you like.</p>
