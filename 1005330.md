<p>If I want to deploy a pod on the development VLAN, and my cluster<br>
resides on the management VLAN, would that be possible?</p>

<p>This is not possible, kubernetes Clusters have it’s own internal network. This network is completely segregated from your local network.</p>
<p>While deploying your kubernetes cluster (doesn’t matter if it’s rancher or any other on-premises kubernetes cluster) you can define on which CIDR your cluster will sit on.</p>
<p>You may be thinking: So if kubernetes has it’s own network, how can I talk to the applications I deployed in my cluster?</p>
<p>You can expose your resources by using a Service or a Ingress. For example: When you create a service with <code>type: LoadBalancer</code> your service will allocate a external or public IP address (endpoint)  that can be accessed from your internal network.</p>
<pre><code>$ kubectl get svc
NAME                                      TYPE           CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)                      AGE
custom-nginx-svc                          LoadBalancer   10.0.10.18   104.155.87.232   80:31549/TCP                 11d
echo-svc                                  LoadBalancer   10.0.10.14   23.251.138.185   80:30668/TCP                 11d
kubernetes                                ClusterIP      10.0.0.1     &lt;none&gt;           443/TCP                      11d
nginx-ing-nginx-ingress-controller        NodePort       10.0.9.184   &lt;none&gt;           80:31745/TCP,443:31748/TCP   25h
nginx-ing-nginx-ingress-default-backend   ClusterIP      10.0.1.169   &lt;none&gt;           80/TCP                       25h
</code></pre>
<p>As can be seen in the example above, there are two services with external IP defined.</p>
<p>In your scenario you need these External IPs to be IPs from your local network. This can be achieved using MetalLB.</p>
<p>In MetalLB you can define which IPs from your local network will be used. For example, the following configuration gives MetalLB control over IPs from <code>192.168.1.240</code> to <code>192.168.1.250</code>:</p>
<pre><code>apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  namespace: metallb-system
  name: config
data:
  config: |
    address-pools:
    - name: default
      protocol: layer2
      addresses:
      - 192.168.1.240-192.168.1.250
</code></pre>
<p>This is tying MetalLB to only one range and that’s not what you need. So, please take a look at <a href="https://www.projectcalico.org/calico-ipam-explained-and-enhanced/">this</a> article where it’s explained how you can create IPPools and use them.</p>
